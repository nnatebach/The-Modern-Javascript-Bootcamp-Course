// Arrays are especially used for when you have ordered information.
// However, arrays are not good for storing piece of data that should be grouped together
// If the order is paramount => Array

// Example: Someone's fitness data including the data of walk, run, exercising hours, ....
// Object is the better fit for that kind of data

const fitbitData = {
  totalSteps: 12354,
  totalMiles: 5123.42,
  avgCaloriesBurn: 11234,
  avgGoodSleep: '2:13'
}

// Objects are collections of properties
// Properties are a key-value pair (pairs of information)
// We access Object data by using custom keys rather than using an index

'asdasd'.length // length is the 'property' of string 'asdasd'

// an object is more like a blob that holds different pieces of data
// key and value pairs where there's not necessarily an order.
